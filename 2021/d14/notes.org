* part 2
** method idea
we keep 2 lists, one of pairs (probably a struct) and how often they occur
(for the test case NNCB)
- NN 1
- NC 1
- CB 1
and occurances of each letter are
- N 2
- C 1
- B 1
. iterate through the list of pairs and use a back-buffer
to put new pairs on, if theres a rule NN -> NC then the string is now NCNCB
and the pair list becomes
- NN 0
- NC 2
- CB 1
- CN 1
occurances of each letter become
- N 2
- C 2
- B 1

** storage details
we can store the occurances using the existing occurances list system
we can generate the worlds shittest hash map by doing:
  0-25 val of 1st char * size + 0-25 val of 2nd char + size
