# Anna's Advent of Code 2021

maybe this year i will actually complete it

## Daily Log

### Day 1

- Fairly easy puzzle today, a nice intro

- Slightly more challenging today
- Had some memory management troubles today

### Day 3

- Screwed up some memory management again today, not the easiest fix

### Day 4

- I had massive memory management issues again today, lots of strange

### Day 5
